            <h2>Phase Three: Main Concept Idea</h2>
            <p>I would like to Design a quiz to find the most suitable pet with more focus on lifestyle of the adopter than the pet, because it covers more options with an easier way than finding a pet by breed, type etc, I have also considered adding an advanced filter after the first quiz.</p>
            <div class="selection">
                <h3>Selection of questions:</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h2>a) What type of house do you live in?</h2></dt>
                    <dd>You can easily filter if the pet is going to be alone or not meanwhile the adopter is working/busy, also if the pet has or needs space to play, run, natural needs. etc, you can also choose if your house has a rural or urban style depending on the size.</dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h2>b) Family members at house?</h2></dt>
                    <dd>I have chosen this question because with this you can find out the age range of the members of the house, if there are kids, seniors, if the adopter lives alone etc. thi shows how the pet can fit in the family in terms of hyperactivity, love, interest.</dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h2>c) How busy are you?</h2></dt>
                    <dd>This option is good in order to understand how much time the adopter can spend with the pet everyday, Some pets need a lot of attention (dogs) such as food, excercise, but other ones can take care by themselves or need less attention (reptiles).</dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h2>d) Do you prefer to stay at home or go out?</h2></dt>
                    <dd>Sometimes the adopter is really busy at work or is working from home, or does not leave the house often, This question is for get the average of pet that can be inside of home without stress.</dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h2>e) Do you like excercising, or doing sports?</h2></dt>
                    <dd>This question is good if you want to find out if the adopter is able to have a pet with a lot of energy, pets such as terrier dogs, or the ones that require lots of your attention. </dd>
                </dl>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        <h2>f) Are you organized with your time?</h2></dt>
                    <dd>I added this question because sometimes the adopters have different schedules, for example because of irregular work hours. Some pets need to be fed at a specific time, but others just eat a little bit, or it is not necessary to consider time. </dd>
                </dl>
            </div>
            <p>It is good to consider an <strong>advanced level of filter and a login for shelters & home fosters</strong>. In my opinion these both have to have the same data/content, relative to the pet features, such as pets age, breed, gender, fur, reptiles, mammals, birds, fish? Health status, temperament, etc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="phase phase-four container ">
            <h2>Phase Four: Concept/Product researching</h2>
            <p>I did a fast research about the status of art and similar products, to get ideas, inspirations, things that can help me to design process and get deeper knowledge about the topic.</p>

                <img src="{{w1}}" alt="">
                <h3>Things to consider in this step:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        I think it is a good way to present features of the pets with a draggable percent, such as health status, temperament, age. It works for the shelters & foster homes (form to upload the pet) and the adopters (quiz and the advanced search).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I tried to do a simple flowchart, I think this exercise can be too big if I start to think in all the details, and this is the kind of project that never ends.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I am still thinking the direction on the questions, and how get the adopter interested, I was thinking to use emotions such as sad, angry, excited, happy, tender and how to display it in the text.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I decided to focus the interaction on some easy behaviors (events/actions), such as drag, drop, touch one click. I think with this way the adopter is going to have a more humanized and enjoyable experience compared to the typical forms, less writing and more action.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>High level Flow Presentation:</h3>
                <p>Just <strong>Drag the canvas</strong> for see the whole flow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="wireframe-container">
                <img src="{{wireframe}}" alt="">

        <div class="phase phase-seven container">
            <h2>Phase Seven: Interactive Prototype</h2>
            <p>For the interactive prototype I kept the idea of a step by step quiz by making a timeline to guide the adopter through the questions.</p>
            <h3>List of interaction/ideas/considerations that I used and why:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Line's journey:</strong> This line has to appear throughout the whole quiz and its task is to guide the adopter through the questions. The "behaviors" and "call to actions" such as touch, drag, are also a part of the line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Image oversized in relation of the canvas: </strong> I decided to use an oversized image of the pet in relation to the canvas because it creates an impression that the pet is closer to the adopter. I also like to use a white background because it improves the legibility of the text, especially when you need to answer questions and read informative text.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Color Palette: </strong> According to colour psychology, the blue colour is communicates "loyalty". I would like to use this concept for the colour.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Typography: </strong> For the typography I used "Chronicle Display Light" & "Helvetica Neue Bold". I think it creates legibility and harmony between the concept and the design. I feel that a "Serif Font" supports the "loyalty" concept, and a Sans-serif font such as Helvetica is good for buttons or information messages.
